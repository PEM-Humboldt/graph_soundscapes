# Graphical soundscapes analysis

This repository provides a simple step by step procedure to analyze raw audio recordings coming from passive acoustic sensors using the approach proposed by Campos-Cerqueira et al., 2017, Forumo et al., 2019, and Campos-Cerqueira et al., 2017.

## Dependencies

To run the scripts you will need the following R packages:

- seewave
- tuneR
- vegan: Community Ecology Package
- ggplot
- viridis

```R
install.packages(c("seewave", "tuneR", "vegan", "ggplot2", "viridis"))
```

## 1. Get audio metadata
First audio metadata is extracted from
